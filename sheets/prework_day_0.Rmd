</br>

A brief history:

- R is a dialect of the S language. 

--

- R was written by .KULbginline[R]obert Gentleman and .KULbginline[R]oss Ihaka in 1992. 

--

- The R source code was first released in 1995.

--

- In 1998, the Comprehensive R Archive Network [CRAN](http://CRAN.R-project.org/) was established.

--

- The first official release, R version 1.0.0, dates to 2000-02-29. Currently R 4.0.3 (October, 2020).

--

- R is open source via the [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License).

# Explore the R architecture

- R is like a car's engine

- RStudio is like a car's dashboard, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

# How do I code in R?

Keep in mind:

- unlike other software like Excel, STATA, or SAS, R is an interpreted language

- no point and click in R!

- .KULbginline[you have to program in R]!

R .KULbginline[packages] extend the functionality of R by providing additional functions, and can be downloaded for free from the internet.

# How to install and load an R package?

.pull-left[

Install the {ggplot2} package for data visualisation

```{r install_ggplot, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Load the installed package

```{r load_ggplot, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

And give it a try

```{r try_ggplot, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
head(diamonds)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, fill = cut)) + 
  geom_bar() + theme_bw()
```

Packages are developed and maintained by R users worldwide. 

They are shared with the R community through CRAN: now 16,460 packages online (on November 2, 2020)!

# Why R and RStudio? 

### Data science positivism

- Next to Python, R has become the *de facto* language for data science, with a cutting edge *machine learning toolbox*.
- See: [The Popularity of Data Science Software](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/)
- R is open-source with a very active community of users spanning academia and industry.

--

### Bridge to actuarial science, econometrics and other tools

- R has all of the statistics and econometrics support, and is amazingly adaptable as a “glue” language to other programming languages and APIs.
- R does not try to be everything to everyone. The RStudio IDE and ecosystem allow for further, seemless integration (with e.g. python, keras, tensorflow or C).
- Widely used in actuarial undergraduate programs 

--

### Disclaimer + Read more

- It's also the language that we know best.

# Principles of tidy data

Three interrelated rules from the [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham:

1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell.

# Workflow of a data scientist

Here is a model of the .hi-pink[tools needed in a typical data science project]: 

> <p align="justify"> Together, tidying and transforming are called <b>wrangling</b>, because getting your data in a form that’s natural to work with often feels like a fight! </p>

> <p align="justify"> Models are complementary tools to visualisation. Once you have made your questions sufficiently precise, you can use a model to answer them. Models are a fundamentally <b>mathematical or computational tool</b>, so they generally scale well. But every model makes <b>assumptions</b>, and by its very nature a model cannot question its own assumptions. That means <b>a model cannot fundamentally surprise you</b>.</p>

# A tibble instead of a data.frame <img src="image/tibble.png" class="title-hex"> 

Within the tidyverse `tibble` is a modern take on a `data.frame`:

- keep the features that have stood the test of time

- drop the features that used to be convenient but are now frustrating. 

--

You can use: 

- `tibble()` to create a new tibble

- `as_tibble()` transforms an object (e.g. a data frame) into a tibble.

--

Quick example: explore the differences!

```{r eval = FALSE}
mtcars
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
as_tibble(mtcars)
```

---

# Chains with the pipe operator <img src="image/pipe.png" class="title-hex">

In R, the pipe operator is `%>%`. 

It takes the output of one statement and makes it the input of the next statement. 

When describing it, you can think of it as a “THEN”; with this operator it becomes easy to chain a sequence of calculations. 

For example, when you have an input data and want to call functions `foo` and `bar` in sequence, you can write `data %>% foo %>% bar`.

--

A first example: 

- take the `diamonds` data (from the {ggplot2} package)

- then subset

```{r eval=FALSE}
diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Ideal")
```

--

Some excellent blog posts about this operator: [Pipes in R tutorial for beginners](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pipe-r-tutorial) and [how to write this in base R](https://gist.github.com/hadley/c430501804349d382ce90754936ab8ec).

# Data manipulation verbs <img src="image/dplyr.png" class="title-hex">

The {dplyr} package holds many useful data manipulation verbs:

- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables

- `select()` picks variables based on their names

- `filter()` picks cases based on their values

- `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary

- `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.

These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to perform any operation “by group”.

--

A first example: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
diamonds %>% mutate(price_per_carat = price/carat) %>% filter(price_per_carat > 1500)
```

or

```{r eval = FALSE}
diamonds %>% group_by(cut) %>% summarize(price = mean(price), carat = mean(carat))
```

.right-column[

To get warmed up, let's do some .KULbginline[basic explorations] of the {tidyverse} instructions. The idea is to get some feel for these functions.

.hi-pink[Q]: you will work through the following exploratory steps.

1.1. Create a data frame (with `data.frame(.)`) or tibble (with `tibble(.)`) `df` with two variables `x` and `y`. Enter some values for these variables. 

1.2. Create a new variable `z` that is the sum of `x` and `y`. Use `base` R instructions and then use the pipe operator and `mutate(.)`.

2.1. Create a new data vector `v` with some entries, use `c(.)`.

2.2. Try the following instructions: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
round(mean(x), 2)
mean(x) %>% round(2)
x %>% mean %>% round(2)
```

]

---

class: clear

.pull-left[

First, you put together the `data.frame`

```{r eval=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(x = c(0, 1), y = c(0, 1))
df 
```

or the `tibble`

```{r eval=FALSE}
df <- tibble(x = c(0, 1), y = c(0, 1))
df 
```

Next, you create a new variable

```{r eval=FALSE}
df$z <- df$x + df$y 
df
```

or with `mutate(.)`

```{r eval=FALSE}
df %>% mutate(z = x+y)
df
```

]

.pull-right[

You create a vector `x` with some entries

```{r}
x <- c(0.157, 0.135, 0.359)
```

and then you evaluate

```{r, eval = FALSE}
round(mean(x), 2)
mean(x) %>% round(2)
x %>% mean %>% round(2)
```

These implementations all lead to the same result:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x <- c(0.157, 0.135, 0.359)
round(mean(x), 2)
```

Which one do you find most intuitive?

# Plots with ggplot2 <img src="image/ggplot2.png" class="title-hex">

The aim of the {ggplot2} package is to create elegant data visualisations using the .hi-pink[grammar of graphics]. 

--

Here are the basic steps:

- begin a plot with the function `ggplot()` creating a coordinate system that you can add layers to

- the first argument of `ggplot()` is the dataset to use in the graph

--

A first example

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg)
ggplot(mpg)
```

creates an empty graph.

You will now add layers to this graph!

---

# Plots with ggplot2 <img src="image/ggplot2.png" class="title-hex">

You complete your graph by adding one or more .hi-pink[layers] to `ggplot()`. 

--

For example: 

- `geom_point()` adds a layer of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot

- `geom_smooth()` adds a smooth line

- `geom_bar` a bar plot

and many more, see [ggplot2 documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

--

Each `geom` function in `ggplot2` takes an aesthetic mapping argument: 

- maps variables in your dataset to visual properties

- always paired with `aes()` and the $x$ and $y$ arguments of `aes()` specify which variables to map to the $x$ and $y$ axes.

---

class: clear

.pull-left[

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, `aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)`) + 
  `geom_point()` + `theme_bw()`

```

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_bw()

```

]

.pull-right[
  
Extend the empty graph now with (here: global) aesthetic mapping argument `aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)`.

This implies: `displ` on the x-axis, `hwy` on the y-axis and `class` to differentiate the color of the plotting symbol. 

With `geom_point` you add a layer of points to the empty graph.

`theme_bw()` changes the `ggtheme` to a simple black-and-white theme.

]

# What else is there? 

Recall 

><p align="justify">The .KULbginline[tidyverse] is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. </p>

There are .KULbginline[(multiple) alternative ways] to do what the packages and functions in the tidyverse do. 

For instance: 

- base R
- the {data.table} package

You can read more about comparisons on e.g. [how to write this in base R](https://gist.github.com/hadley/c430501804349d382ce90754936ab8ec) or [Base R, the tidyverse, and data.table: a comparison of R dialects to wrangle your data](https://wetlandscapes.com/blog/a-comparison-of-r-dialects/).
